I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Robotics and Neural Computation program at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to study theoretical and computational neuroscience in the [Laboratory for the Algorithmic Brain](xaqlab.com) with [Xaq Pitkow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ony4DjAAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests lie in the NeuroAI space, ranging from bio-inspired machine learning for applications in robotics to traditional computational analysis of neural data. My goal is to uncover principles of neural engineering and information processing that allow artificial systems, particularly embodied ones (aka, robots), to operate more efficiently. I try take a holistic approach my research by finding inspiration from the rich history of experimental neuroscience, control theory, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, game theory, reinforcement learning, and robotics that has formed the modern AI field. 

With all the recent exciting progress in large-language models enabled by high-performance computing, I often get asked about the purpose in studying the low-compute machine learning models common in academia. As much as I believe in the [bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html), I also believe that we cannot achieve a complete general intelligence (sensorimotor + language) without the right inductive biases. These inductive biases may come from clever engineering, not-so-clever data/compute scaling, or something else entirely; however, because we ourselves are model systems for the hardest problems in AI, I believe that studying ourselves, our brains, and our behavior is as good approach as any to understanding what intelligence is and how to engineer it. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
